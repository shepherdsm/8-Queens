My take on solving the 8-queens problem. Currently solves it by treating
each row in the board as a number and XOR'ing it with possible valid moves.

The CLI driver runs it with the most naive approach to solving the problem
by attempting all solutions and not caring whether it's a reflection
of a previous solve. So it attempts every single configuration. No bueno. :(
Later versions will add a solution to this, but that's way too much work
currently.

TODO:
1. Write Main GUI using PySide (PyQt4):
    - Display chess board
    - Display "Solution #" above said chess board
    - Allow user to change size of board
    - Allow user to browse through solutions
2. Add spiffy features into GUI other than just display the board such as:
    - Skip to beginning
    - Skip to End (Slightly dangerous this one)
    - Skip to N
3. Add more spiffy features into the GUI such as:
    - Change color of tiles
    - Change color of queen
    - Change Queen marker (Maybe)
4. Look into separating the queen finder into a thread to allow user to browse
    without needing to wait (necessarily).
5. Program less naive implementations to solve the 8-Queens problem.

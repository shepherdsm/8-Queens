My take on solving the 8-queens problem. Currently solves it by treating
each row in the board as a number and XOR'ing it with possible valid moves.

The CLI driver runs it with the most naive approach to solving the problem
by attempting all solutions and not caring whether it's a reflection
of a previous solve. So it attempts every single configuration. No bueno. :(
Later versions will add a solution to this, but that's way too much work
currently.

Right now, focusing on adding in a GUI to display the solutions utilizing
PySide or some such. Also, maybe some threads? Who knows.
